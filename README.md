# Rust Fields
Rust Fields is a Rust-based implementation of the Aggregate Computing paradigm, that lets you program the behaviour
of a Collective Adaptive System by manipulating Computational Fields.

This framework is composed of the following modules:
- [RuFi Core](crates/rf-core/README.md): provides the basic concepts and functionalities for the RuFi framework.
- [RuFi Distributed](crates/rf-distributed/README.md): provides types and functionalities for executing RuFi programs in a distributed fashion.

## Structure of this repository
This repository is structured as follows:
- `crates`: contains the library crates of the RuFi framework.
- `examples`: contains some binary applications with examples of RuFi usage.

## Running the examples
In order to run the examples, please follow the instructions in the [examples directory](examples/README.md).
