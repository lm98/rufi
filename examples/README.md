# RuFi - Examples
This directory contains some binary applications with examples of RuFi usage.

- Local gradient:
  This example will execute a gradient aggregate algorithm inside a single process.

- Distributed gradient:
  This example will launch 5 different processes, each one representing a node in the topology and communicating with the others.

## Running the examples
In order to run any example, please refer to the [README.md](../README.md) file in the project root folder.
