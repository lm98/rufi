of a Collective Adaptive System by manipulating Computational Fields.

This framework is composed of the following modules:
- [RuFi Core](../rf-core/README.md): provides the basic concepts and functionalities for the RuFi framework.
- [RuFi Distributed](../rf-distributed/README.md): provides types and functionalities for executing RuFi programs in a distributed fashion.
