/// * `vm` - The current VM.

/// The result of the evaluation of the then-expression if the condition is true, else the result of the evaluation of the else-expression alongside the RoundVM.

///
/// * `A` The type of value returned by the expression.

/// * `G` - The type of aggr, which must be a closure that takes a tuple `(A, A)` and returns a value of type `A`.
/// * `H` - The type of expr, which must be a closure that takes a `RoundVM` as argument and returns a tuple `(RoundVM, A)`.
